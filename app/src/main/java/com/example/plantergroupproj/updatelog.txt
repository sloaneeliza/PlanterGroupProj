What I did:
- Created a functional HerbSelection class
- Created cards for each herb.
- Created Recipe Fragment
Current issues:
- Recipes on RecipeFragment is printed twice.
- Home button on BasilCard screen doesn't have any functionality
- HerbSelection only works for BasilCard so functionality needs
  to be extended for our other cards as production goes on.
- Only one recipe is being listed in BasilCard instead of 3.
