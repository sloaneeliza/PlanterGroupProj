What I did:
- Created a functional HerbSelection class
- Created cards for each herb.
- Created Recipe Fragment
Current issues:
- Recipes on RecipeFragment is printed twice.
- Home button on BasilCard screen doesn't have any functionality
- HerbSelection only works for BasilCard so functionality needs
  to be extended for our other cards as production goes on.
- Only one recipe is being listed in BasilCard instead of 3.

** note that the leaf image being used in the BasilCard
   is just a generic leaf photo and will need to be updated.
   It's a placeholder for now while we are in early stages
   of development

What I did:
- Made it where the recipes under each herb has a simple
  description. If the user taps on the description, it opens
  a different page that has the full description and and an
  image of the food.

What needs to be added:
- RecipeDetailActivity needs the "Save" button to be added. It
  also needs a "Home" button and a back arrow to be added.
- Additional recipes for Basil and our other recipes need to be added
  as well in the RecipeFragment class. (these are being hardcoded)

Current issues:
- UI isn't identical to the UI in Figma, which I am just aiming for
  functionality right now.
- The word "Recipe" is being printed twice in our RecipeFragment. I
  am unsure if this is an issue in the XML or in the Java file.
